Procedure for the experiment is as follows.

Simply Supported Rectangular Plate Calculate the deflection at the center of a simply supported isotropic plate subjected to:
A. Concentrated load F = 400 lbs, and
B. Uniform pressure P = 1 psi.
Dimensions of the plate are as follows: h = 1 in, a = b = 40 in.
Material Properties: Modulus of elasticity = 3 X 107 psi, Poisson's ratio = 0.3.


|Case|Plate width|Plate length|Plate thickness|Modules of Elasticity|Poisson's ration|Deflection|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Uniform Load|   |   |   |   |   |   |
|Concentrated force|   |   |   |   |   |   |
